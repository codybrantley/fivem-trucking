## What is it?
A FiveM (FiveM is a multiplayer modification framework for GTA V, allowing you to play on customized multiplayer servers.) game mode designed to simulate hot shot trucking (single location, time-sensitive delivery jobs). 

## What does it do?
Inspired by Euro Trucking Simulator, a video game that simulates the career of a truck driver, this gamemode provides a similar feel of allowing players to fulfill delivery jobs for fictitious companies around the world of GTA V.  

Players who sign up gain access to the trucker mobile app, which provides tools to search for nearby jobs, viewing their delivery reports, and the ability to participate in auctions for high-paying exclusive jobs. Upon accepting each job, players are tasked to deliver the specified goods from Point A to Point B in a timely fashion, and are graded in their delivery speed and parking perfection. Each job pays a set price initially, with the ability to gain bonuses, and the potential to face payout deductions based on their performance.
